# mdpye's planck layout, MacOS edition

Also available for jj40 board.

A map which evolved from hewing as closely as possible to the UK English QWERTY
layout and tweaking as necessary to obtain comfort over several years.

The MacOS edition moves the left GUI to be more available, and uses
alt-left/right for per-word movement.
